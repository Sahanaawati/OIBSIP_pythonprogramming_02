Password Generator Project Summary :

Objective :
To create a Python-based password generator that produces strong, random passwords based on user-defined criteria such as length, inclusion of letters, numbers, and symbols.

Steps Performed :

Collected user input for desired password length.

Asked users whether to include letters, numbers, and symbols.

Built a character pool based on the user’s preferences.

Used Python’s random module to generate a secure password.

Displayed the generated password to the user.

Added validation to ensure valid length and at least one character set selected.

Tools & Technologies Used:

Language : Python

Modules : random, string

IDE/Editor : VS Code

Concepts Applied: Functions, Loops, Conditional Statements, Randomization, User Input Handling

Outcome :

Successfully developed a working password generator.

Learned how to use Python’s built-in libraries for randomization.

Understood importance of password security and user input validation.

Created a customizable tool that generates secure passwords for different use cases.
